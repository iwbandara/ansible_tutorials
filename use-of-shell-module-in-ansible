# Use of 'shell' module in Ansible

    this is used to run UNIX commands on the shell

    ansible servers -m shell -a 'ls -la'

The "shell" module in Ansible is used to run shell commands on the remote hosts. This module can be used to run any command that can be run on the 
command line of a Linux or Unix-based system.

The basic syntax of the "shell" module is as follows:

- name: Run a shell command on a remote host
  shell: "command_to_run"

The "command_to_run" is a string that contains the command that you want to run on the remote host. It can include arguments and options, 
just as if you were running the command directly on the command line.

One of the main use of "shell" module is to run commands that are not available as ansible modules. As it allows the execution of any shell command,
it gives more flexibility in terms of customizing the operation.

For example, if you need to check the free space of a remote host, you can use the command "df -h" which will give the output as the 
free disk space on the remote host.

Another example would be, to check if a service is running or not, you can use the command "systemctl status <service_name>" 
which will give the status of the service on the remote host.

It is important to note that, using shell module could be less secure and less idempotent than using an ansible module, 
therefore it should be used with care and when there is no other option.

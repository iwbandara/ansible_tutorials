# Using SSH keys to login to remote servers to automate the tasks using Ansible is important

# Generating SSH keys
  $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ansible keys" # this will create an ed25519 key type

# The above command creates two key types (Private & Public)

# Copy the generated Public key (xxx.pub) to managed hosts

  $ ssh-copy-id <path-of-ssh-key> <remote-host-ip>
  $ ssh-copy-id ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub 192.168.1.112

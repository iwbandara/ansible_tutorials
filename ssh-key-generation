# Using SSH keys to login to remote servers to automate the tasks using Ansible is important

# SSH key pairs are two cryptographically secure keys that can be used to authenticate a client to an SSH server. 
  Each key pair consists of a public key and a private key. The private key is retained by the client and should be kept absolutely secret. 
  Any compromise of the private key will allow the attacker to log into servers that are configured with the associated public key without additional authentication.
  The public key is uploaded to a remote server that you want to be able to log into with SSH.

# Generating RSA Keys:
  $ ssh-keygen // will create RSA type SSH-keys.

# Generating SSH keys (Type ed25519):
  $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ansible keys" # this will create an ed25519 key type

# The above command creates two key types (Private & Public)

# Copy the generated Public key (xxx.pub) to managed hosts

  $ ssh-copy-id <path-of-ssh-key> <remote-host-ip>
  $ ssh-copy-id ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub 192.168.1.112

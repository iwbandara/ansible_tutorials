# Use of 'setup' module

The "setup" module in Ansible is used to gather information about the remote hosts on which it is run. This module can be used to gather a wide range of information, including system facts, network information, and information about installed software.

The "setup" module is run by default on all hosts specified in the inventory file when the "gather_facts" option is set to "true" in the playbook. The information gathered by the "setup" module is stored in a variable called "ansible_facts", which can be accessed by other modules and tasks in the playbook.

The gathered information can be used to make decisions about how to configure the remote host, for example, if a specific software is installed or not, based on the gathered facts, the playbook can proceed with appropriate action.

The setup module can also be run explicitly by including the "setup" module in a task and specifying the hosts on which it should be run.

The setup module can also be run with the -m option along with ansible command.

Example:
ansible all -m setup

This will gather all the facts from all the hosts specified in the inventory file.
